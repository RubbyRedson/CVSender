HH test
This is an assignment from school.hh.ru to enter its android development school. I don't really think that anyone except
the examinators would see it, but just in casr this app supports both Russian and English languages and is relatively
simple. Its sole purpose is to send a pseudo CV to another activity and then send a response back. However there are 
some limitations on input in the first activity.
